## Getting Started 

* `app-root` is  an angular component 

  * Entry point for our applications

* Angular 4 is meant to be used with TypeScript (.ts)
   * The `ng serve` command will convert ts to js

## Components
* The purpose of a component is to teach the browser new html tags with their own custom functionality
* components ` ===` directives
* Components have two parts
  * 1. A `Component` decorator
  * 2. A component definition class
* An import statement defines modules we want to write in our code
* 	* Imports are similar to java or ruby imports
* 	* A common dependency is `Component` which is from the `@angular/core` module..
